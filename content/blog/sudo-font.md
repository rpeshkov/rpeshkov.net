For quite a long time I've been searching for the font that looks really close to
[Envy Code R](https://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released) but have cyrillic
support. And finally I've found it! Behold the bringer of light - [Sudo](https://www.kutilek.de/sudo-font/).
