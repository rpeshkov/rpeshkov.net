Hello, my name is Roman.

I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience.

Mainly focused on frontend development using modern frameworks like React. Has strong skills in backend development using C# and .NET, but this knowledge might be outdated.

Very interested in software engineering in general and continuously studying new things in this area.
